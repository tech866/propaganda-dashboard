## Recommendations for Your Project

Given your **Next.js 15 + TypeScript** stack, **Vercel deployment**, and need for reliable team invitation emails:

- **Resend** is highly recommended for its modern developer experience, JSX template support, and seamless integration with Next.js API routes and Server Actions[1][3].
- **SendGrid** and **Postmark** are excellent for robust deliverability and template management, with straightforward integration and good analytics[1][3].
- **AWS SES** is best for high-volume, cost-sensitive scenarios, especially if you already use AWS services[2][3].
- **Nodemailer** is suitable if you want full control and are comfortable managing SMTP credentials, but may require more effort for deliverability and scaling[2].

**Actionable Next Steps:**
- Choose a provider based on your volume, budget, and template needs.
- Use the provided integration examples to set up your Next.js API route for sending team invitations.
- For dynamic, branded invitations, prefer services with built-in or JSX template support (Resend, SendGrid).
- For high deliverability and analytics, SendGrid or Postmark are strong choices.

This approach ensures your team invitation emails are reliable, scalable, and easy to maintain within your existing Next.js architecture.
