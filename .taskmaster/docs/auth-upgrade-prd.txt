# Authentication Upgrade PRD
## Next.js 15 + Clerk + Supabase + Tailus UI Integration

### Project Overview
Upgrade the existing propaganda dashboard application to replace mock development authentication with Clerk's official authentication system, integrated with Supabase for role-based access control.

### Current State
- Next.js 15 App Router application
- Mock development login form in place
- Supabase database with existing schema
- Tailus UI components
- Existing test suite with Jest + React Testing Library
- Role-based access control partially implemented

### Goals
1. Replace mock authentication with Clerk's official authentication modal
2. Integrate Clerk with Supabase for seamless user management
3. Implement proper route protection using Clerk middleware
4. Maintain role-based access control (ADMIN, USER, PROFESSIONAL)
5. Ensure all existing tests pass
6. Provide production-ready authentication flow

### Technical Requirements

#### Authentication System
- Use Clerk's `<SignIn />` and `<SignUp />` modal components
- Implement proper Clerk provider setup in layout.tsx
- Create dedicated sign-in and sign-up pages using App Router
- Configure environment variables for Clerk integration
- Redirect successful authentication to dashboard

#### Route Protection
- Implement Clerk middleware for route protection
- Protect dashboard and admin routes
- Allow public access to home page and auth pages
- Handle unauthorized access with proper redirects

#### Database Integration
- Sync Clerk user IDs with Supabase users table
- Maintain role-based access control
- Update database schema if needed for role management
- Ensure user metadata is properly stored

#### Testing Requirements
- Test Clerk modal rendering and functionality
- Test login/logout flow
- Test route protection and redirects
- Test role-based access restrictions
- Maintain existing test coverage
- Add snapshot tests for authentication components

### Success Criteria
- Mock login form completely removed
- Clerk authentication modals working properly
- All routes properly protected
- Role-based access control functioning
- All tests passing
- Production-ready authentication flow

### Dependencies
- Clerk account and API keys
- Supabase project with existing schema
- Next.js 15 App Router
- Existing test infrastructure

### Deliverables
1. Updated layout.tsx with ClerkProvider
2. New sign-in and sign-up pages with Clerk modals
3. Middleware configuration for route protection
4. Updated Supabase schema for role integration
5. Comprehensive test suite for authentication
6. Documentation for authentication flow

### Timeline
This is a critical upgrade that should be completed in phases to ensure system stability and maintain existing functionality.
