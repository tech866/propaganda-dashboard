# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Performance Metrics Calculations
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create backend logic to calculate Show Rate and Close Rate based on call data.
# Details:
Develop functions to calculate Show Rate and Close Rate from the Calls table. Ensure these calculations are optimized for performance, especially with large datasets.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for the calculation functions. Validate that metrics are calculated correctly for various scenarios.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Understand Business Logic for Metrics [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Gather and document the business rules for calculating Show Rate and Close Rate.
### Details:
Consult with stakeholders to clarify how Show Rate and Close Rate are defined and calculated based on call data.

## Business Logic Analysis Complete ✅

### Key Findings:

**Show Rate Calculation:**
- Formula: (Completed Calls / Total Scheduled Calls) × 100
- Numerator: Calls with `status = 'completed'`
- Denominator: All calls regardless of status
- Includes: completed, no-show, rescheduled calls in denominator
- Excludes: None from denominator

**Close Rate Calculation:**
- Formula: (Won Calls / Completed Calls) × 100  
- Numerator: Calls with `status = 'completed'` AND `outcome = 'won'`
- Denominator: Calls with `status = 'completed'` (regardless of outcome)
- Excludes: no-show and rescheduled calls from denominator
- Handles: `tbd` outcomes (excluded from numerator, included in denominator)

**Data Requirements:**
- Primary table: `calls` with key fields: status, outcome, client_id, user_id, completed_at
- Multi-tenant isolation: All queries must filter by `client_id`
- Role-based access: Sales (own data), Admin (client data), CEO (all clients)

**Loss Reasons Analysis:**
- Top 5 loss reasons by count
- Percentage calculation: (Calls with reason / Total lost calls) × 100
- Categories: Price, Interest, Timing, Competition, Technical, Internal

**Edge Cases Handled:**
- Zero division: Return 0% instead of undefined
- Missing data: Appropriate NULL handling
- Invalid status: Exclude from calculations
- Future dates: Don't include in calculations

**Performance Requirements:**
- Target: P95 < 300ms for up to 50k calls per client
- Caching: 15min for real-time, 1hr for historical
- Optimization: Database indexes and efficient queries

### Documentation Created:
- Comprehensive business logic document: `.taskmaster/docs/metrics-business-logic.md`
- Includes formulas, examples, edge cases, and implementation notes
- Defines API response format and testing considerations

## 2. Create Database Queries for Metrics [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop optimized SQL queries to retrieve necessary data for Show Rate and Close Rate calculations.
### Details:
Ensure queries are efficient and can handle large datasets without performance degradation.

## Database Queries Implementation Complete ✅

### Key Deliverables:

**1. Comprehensive MetricsService Created:**
- `src/lib/services/metricsService.ts` - Complete service layer with optimized SQL queries
- Implements all business logic from Task 7.1 documentation
- Handles multi-tenant data isolation and role-based access

**2. Core Metrics Queries:**
- **Show Rate Query:** `(Completed Calls / Total Calls) × 100`
- **Close Rate Query:** `(Won Calls / Completed Calls) × 100`
- **Loss Reasons Query:** Top 5 with percentages
- **Performance Comparison:** User vs user metrics
- **Trend Analysis:** Time-series data over configurable periods

**3. Advanced Features:**
- **Role-based filtering:** Sales (own data), Admin (client data), CEO (all data)
- **Date range filtering:** Flexible date boundaries
- **Performance optimization:** Efficient SQL with proper indexing considerations
- **Edge case handling:** Zero division, NULL values, invalid data

**4. API Integration:**
- Updated `/api/metrics` to use real database queries
- Added `/api/metrics/trend` for time-series data
- Added `/api/metrics/performance` for user comparisons
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing API structure

**5. Query Performance:**
- Single-query approach for basic metrics (reduces database round trips)
- Optimized JOINs for loss reasons analysis
- Proper parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Efficient aggregation with CASE statements

**6. Data Structure:**
- Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Consistent response format across all endpoints
- Proper error handling and validation
- Multi-tenant data isolation at query level

### Technical Implementation:
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with optimized queries
- **Performance:** Target <300ms for up to 50k calls per client
- **Security:** Role-based access control in queries
- **Scalability:** Efficient aggregation and filtering
- **Maintainability:** Clean service layer architecture

All queries tested against the existing database schema and ready for integration with the calculation functions in Task 7.3.
