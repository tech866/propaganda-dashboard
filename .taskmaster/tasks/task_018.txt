# Description: Develop a Client Management page for admin users to manage client accounts, view client performance, and configure client settings.
# Details:
Build a comprehensive Client Management page that includes client CRUD operations, performance dashboards per client, and client-specific analytics. Ensure proper RBAC access control so only admin users can access this page. Use the v0.dev dark theme design and shadcn/ui components for consistency.

# Test Strategy:
Test the Client Management page with different user roles to ensure only admin users can access it. Verify that all CRUD operations work correctly and that client-specific data is displayed properly.
