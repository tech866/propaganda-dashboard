# Task ID: 18
# Title: Create Client Management Page
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a Client Management page for admin users to manage client accounts, view client performance, and configure client settings.
# Details:
Build a comprehensive Client Management page that includes client CRUD operations, performance dashboards per client, and client-specific analytics.

**Current Analysis:**
- ✅ Client management page UI is enhanced with modern v0.dev dark theme styling
- ✅ Existing ClientService class is available with comprehensive CRUD methods
- ✅ Client API routes exist at /api/clients/route.ts
- ⚠️ Current page uses mock data instead of real database operations
- ⚠️ Need to integrate ClientService with the enhanced UI

**Implementation Plan:**
1. **Replace Mock Data**: Connect the client management page to use ClientService instead of mock data
2. **Integrate Real API Calls**: Update fetchClients function to use actual database queries
3. **Add CRUD Functionality**: Implement create, update, delete operations with proper error handling
4. **Connect to Agency Context**: Ensure proper agency-based data filtering
5. **Add Loading States**: Implement proper loading and error states for all operations
6. **Test Integration**: Verify all CRUD operations work correctly with the enhanced UI

**Next Steps:**
- Update the client management page to use ClientService
- Replace mock data with real database operations
- Add proper error handling and loading states
- Test all CRUD operations

# RBAC Implementation for Client Management Page

## Current Analysis
- ✅ Client management page already has basic role checking in the component
- ✅ RoleContext is already integrated and working
- ✅ Access denied UI is already implemented
- ⚠️ Need to enhance RBAC implementation for more granular control
- ⚠️ Need to add middleware-level protection
- ⚠️ Need to implement API-level access control

## Implementation Plan
1. **Enhance Component-Level RBAC**: Improve existing role checking in the client management page
2. **Add Middleware Protection**: Implement middleware to protect the /admin/clients route
3. **API-Level Access Control**: Add role checking to client-related API endpoints
4. **Granular Permissions**: Implement specific permissions for different client operations
5. **Audit Logging**: Add audit logging for client management actions
6. **Testing**: Test access control with different user roles

## Key Features to Implement
- Middleware protection for admin routes
- API endpoint role validation
- Granular permissions for CRUD operations
- Audit logging for security compliance
- Enhanced error handling for unauthorized access
- Role-based UI element visibility

## Next Steps
- Examine existing RBAC implementation
- Enhance middleware for route protection
- Add API-level access control
- Implement granular permissions
- Test with different user roles
