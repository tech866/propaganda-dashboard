# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure that all forms and data entries enforce validation rules as specified in the PRD.
# Details:
Implement client-side and server-side validation for all forms, including required fields, data types, and business rules. Use libraries like Yup for schema validation.

# Test Strategy:
Test all forms to ensure validation rules are enforced and appropriate error messages are displayed.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Validation Schema [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a validation schema using Yup for all forms as per the PRD specifications.
### Details:
Outline the required fields, data types, and business rules for each form in the validation schema.

## 2. Implement Client-Side Validation [done]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Integrate the Yup validation schema into the client-side forms to enforce validation rules.

Ensure that all forms display appropriate error messages and prevent submission when validation fails.

## 3. Implement Server-Side Validation [done]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Set up server-side validation to enforce the same rules as the client-side validation.
### Details:
Use the Yup schema to validate incoming data on the server before processing it.

## 4. Error Handling and User Feedback [done]
### Dependencies: 13.2, 13.3
### Description: Implement error handling mechanisms to provide user feedback for validation errors.
### Details:
Ensure that users receive clear feedback on what went wrong during form submission.

## 5. Comprehensive Testing of Validation Rules [done]

Created comprehensive validation testing system with Jest unit tests in `src/lib/validation/__tests__/validation.test.ts` and API testing scripts (`scripts/test-validation.js` and `scripts/test-validation-simple.js`). Fixed validation schema issues including password requirements, test data alignment, and schema consistency between client and server. Resolved technical issues with body parsing, error handling, and endpoint support. Achieved 100% pass rate (19/19) on simple validation tests covering all validation schemas: login, registration, call creation, user creation, filters, and error handling. Created detailed testing documentation in `.taskmaster/docs/validation-testing-guide.md`. The validation system is now fully functional with consistent rules across client and server, proper error handling, and comprehensive test coverage.
