# Task ID: 24
# Title: Enhance Call Logging Form with Comprehensive Field Updates and Modern Styling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 20, 22
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive call logging form that integrates with Supabase and includes all required fields for proper data collection.
# Details:
1. **Form Structure**: Implement a form that includes all specified fields: First Name, Last Name, Source of Set Appointment, Call Outcome, Initial Payment Collected On, Customer Full Name, Customer Email, Calls Taken, Setter First Name, Setter Last Name, How Much Cash Collected Upfront, How Much Owed In Total, Prospect Notes, and Lead Source. 2. **Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS to apply a modern dark theme with glassmorphism effects. Ensure the form is responsive and accessible, with proper labels and focus states. 3. **Validation**: Implement real-time form validation using a library like Formik or React Hook Form, providing immediate feedback for required fields. 4. **Supabase Integration**: Connect the form to Supabase for data persistence, ensuring that form submissions are correctly handled and stored in the database. 5. **Calculations**: Add functionality to calculate metrics such as close rate and show rate based on the input data. 6. **Testing**: Ensure that the form behaves correctly across different devices and screen sizes, and that all validation and submission processes work as intended.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that all form fields are present and correctly labeled. 2. Test the responsiveness of the form on various devices. 3. Check that real-time validation works for all required fields, providing appropriate feedback. 4. Submit the form with valid and invalid data to ensure proper handling and error messages. 5. Confirm that data is correctly saved to Supabase and that calculations for metrics are accurate. 6. Conduct accessibility testing to ensure compliance with WCAG standards.
