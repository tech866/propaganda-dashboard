# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Role-Based Access Control in UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure that the frontend UI respects user roles and permissions for displaying features and data.
# Details:
Use context or state management to manage user roles in the frontend. Conditionally render components based on user permissions (e.g., Admin features only for Admin users).

# Test Strategy:
Log in as different user roles and verify that the UI displays the correct components and data based on permissions.
