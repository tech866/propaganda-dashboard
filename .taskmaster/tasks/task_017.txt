## 2. Integrate Metrics API [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Connect the Performance page to existing metrics API endpoints for real-time data retrieval.
### Details:
Ensure that the API integration supports all required metrics for the dashboard.
<info added on 2025-10-01T13:52:22.787Z>
**Current Analysis:**
- ✅ Performance page structure exists with comprehensive layout
- ✅ Enhanced design with modern glassmorphism effects completed
- ⚠️ Currently using mock data in performanceService.ts
- ⚠️ Need to integrate with real database and API endpoints

**Integration Plan:**
1. **Connect to Real Data Sources**: Replace mock data with actual database queries
2. **Enhance API Endpoints**: Create/update API routes for performance metrics
3. **Integrate Enhanced Call Logging Data**: Connect with the new enhanced call logging system
4. **Add Real-time Calculations**: Implement actual metrics calculations (ROAS, conversion rates, etc.)
5. **Optimize Performance**: Add caching and efficient data fetching
6. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling and fallbacks

**Data Sources to Integrate:**
- Enhanced call logging data from sales_calls table
- Ad spend data from ad_spend table
- Client and user data for breakdowns
- Campaign data for performance analysis
- Real-time metrics calculations

**Next Steps:**
- Update performanceService.ts to use real database queries
- Create API endpoints for performance metrics
- Integrate with existing enhanced call logging system
- Test data integration and calculations

## 3. Implement Role-Based Access Control [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up RBAC to control access to the Performance page based on user roles.
### Details:
Define user roles and permissions to ensure only authorized users can access specific features.
<info added on 2025-10-01T13:58:05.218Z>
**Current Analysis:**
- ✅ Performance page already has basic RBAC with RoleBasedAccess component
- ✅ Currently restricts access to admin and ceo roles only
- ✅ Enhanced metrics API has proper user role filtering
- ⚠️ Need to verify and enhance RBAC implementation throughout the performance system

**RBAC Implementation Plan:**
1. **Verify Current RBAC**: Check existing RoleBasedAccess implementation
2. **Enhance Access Control**: Ensure proper role-based data filtering
3. **Test Different User Roles**: Verify access restrictions work correctly
4. **Add Role-Specific Features**: Implement role-based UI elements and data access
5. **Security Validation**: Ensure no data leakage between roles
6. **Error Handling**: Implement proper access denied handling

**User Roles to Support:**
- **CEO**: Full access to all data across all clients
- **Admin**: Access to their client's data only
- **Sales**: Access to their own data only
- **Other roles**: Restricted or no access

**Next Steps:**
- Examine current RoleBasedAccess implementation
- Test access control with different user roles
- Enhance RBAC if needed
- Verify data filtering works correctly
