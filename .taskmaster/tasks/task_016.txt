# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Modern v0-Style Dashboard Design
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 9, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update the dashboard layout, navigation, metrics cards, and overall UI to align with modern design patterns using shadcn/ui components while maintaining existing RBAC functionality and filtering capabilities.
# Details:
1. Review the current dashboard layout and identify areas for improvement based on modern design principles. 2. Utilize shadcn/ui components to create a responsive and visually appealing dashboard. 3. Ensure that the new design preserves all existing role-based access control (RBAC) functionalities, allowing users to see only the data they are permitted to view. 4. Integrate the filtering capabilities developed in Task 11 to ensure users can filter metrics effectively. 5. Conduct user testing to gather feedback on the new design and make iterative improvements. 6. Ensure that all changes are documented and adhere to the existing code standards and practices.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that the new dashboard layout is responsive and visually consistent across different devices and screen sizes. 2. Test all navigation elements to ensure they function correctly and lead to the appropriate sections of the application. 3. Confirm that all metrics cards display the correct data and update in real-time as per user interactions. 4. Validate that RBAC functionality is intact by logging in with different user roles and ensuring that the UI elements are displayed according to permissions. 5. Test the filtering functionality to ensure it works seamlessly with the new dashboard design, applying various filters and verifying the displayed data updates accordingly.
