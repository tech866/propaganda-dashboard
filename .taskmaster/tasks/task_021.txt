# Task ID: 21
# Title: Implement Meta Marketing API Integration for Client Workspaces
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive integration with the Meta Marketing API to allow clients to connect their Facebook/Instagram ad accounts and display real-time ad spend data in dedicated workspaces.
# Details:
1. Implement the Meta OAuth authentication flow using OAuth 2.0 to securely connect client accounts. Ensure proper handling of long-lived access tokens and refresh mechanisms. 2. Develop backend logic to fetch ad spend data, impressions, clicks, and conversion metrics from the Meta Marketing API. 3. Create a client workspace UI that displays performance metrics, including individual campaign performance breakdowns and historical data with date range filtering. 4. Implement a multi-client management system to allow agencies to manage multiple client accounts seamlessly. 5. Ensure real-time data updates and caching strategies are in place to optimize performance and reduce API calls. 6. Follow best practices for secure token storage and error handling, including rate limiting. 7. Design the UI to match the existing v0 design system, ensuring a professional and cohesive look.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify the OAuth authentication flow by connecting a test Facebook/Instagram account and ensuring tokens are stored securely. 2. Test the API integration by fetching ad spend data and confirming it displays correctly in the client workspace. 3. Validate the performance metrics calculations against known values from the Meta Marketing API. 4. Conduct user testing to ensure the UI is intuitive and meets design specifications. 5. Test the multi-client management functionality by adding, removing, and switching between client accounts. 6. Ensure real-time updates are functioning by simulating changes in ad spend data and verifying updates in the UI.
