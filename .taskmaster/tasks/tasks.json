        "details": "1. **Theme Integration:**\n   - Install and configure the Supabase theme from TweakCN using shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS. Import the theme preset (e.g., via `npx shadcn@latest add https://www.shadcn.io/registry/supabase.json` or use `@madooei/shadcn-theme-presets` for runtime theme management)[2][3][4].\n   - Ensure the theme is globally applied, including dark mode defaults and semantic color variables in the global CSS.\n\n2. **Component Refactoring:**\n   - Audit all pages (Log Call, View Calls, Enhanced Call Logging, Ad Spend) for deviations from the theme.\n   - Update the Log Call button to use theme-compliant background, border, and hover states (replace white backgrounds with semantic theme colors).\n   - Refactor the View Calls page to remove non-theme colors (white/purple/blue) and apply theme palette for backgrounds, text, and accents.\n   - Fix the Enhanced Call Logging page FormField error by ensuring all form components use shadcn/ui primitives and theme variables for error states, borders, and focus rings.\n   - Update the Ad Spend page to match the styling guide: use theme backgrounds, text, and accent colors, and ensure consistent spacing and typography.\n\n3. **Best Practices:**\n   - Use Tailwind CSS utility classes with theme variables for all custom styles.\n   - Ensure all interactive elements (buttons, inputs, links) have accessible contrast and consistent focus/hover states.\n   - Remove hardcoded colors and replace with semantic tokens from the theme.\n   - Test in both dark and light modes (if supported), but prioritize dark mode as default.\n   - Document any custom overrides in a central theme file for maintainability.\n\n4. **Tooling:**\n   - Use Prettier and ESLint to enforce code style.\n   - Leverage Storybook or a similar tool to visually verify component consistency if available.\n\n5. **Collaboration:**\n   - Communicate with design stakeholders to confirm visual alignment with the TweakCN Supabase theme and the styling guide.\n\n6. **Implementation Progress:**\n   - **Log Call Page (/calls/new):**\n     - Replaced white background (bg-gray-50) with dark theme gradient\n     - Updated loading state to use primary theme colors\n     - Implemented proper dark theme colors for success state\n     - Aligned error message styling with dark theme guidelines\n   \n   - **View Calls Page (/calls):**\n     - Implemented dark theme gradient background throughout\n     - Added slate-800/50 backdrop blur and proper borders to header\n     - Updated navigation with primary color accents and hover states\n     - Redesigned main content card with slate-800/50 background and rounded corners\n     - Applied dark theme colors to table with proper contrast\n     - Converted all status and outcome badges to use theme colors\n     - Implemented dark theme styling for empty state\n     - Replaced purple accent colors with primary theme colors\n     - Added consistent hover effects and transitions\n     - Incorporated glassmorphism effects per TweakCN Supabase guidelines\n\n   - **Enhanced Call Logging Page (/calls/enhanced):**\n     - Fixed FormField import error by replacing all instances with EnhancedFormField\n     - Updated all purple colors to use primary theme colors throughout the page\n     - Implemented dark theme gradient background with proper semantic colors\n     - Added glassmorphism effects with backdrop blur and proper borders\n     - Ensured consistent primary color usage for all interactive elements\n     - Applied proper semantic color classes for text and backgrounds\n     - Enhanced hover and focus states with primary theme colors\n     - All components now follow TweakCN Supabase theme guidelines\n     \n   - **Ad Spend Page (/ad-spend):**\n     - Updated loading state from white background and blue spinner to dark theme gradient and primary colors\n     - Replaced main page background (bg-gray-50) with dark theme gradient (bg-gradient-to-br from-slate-900 via-slate-800 to-slate-900)\n     - Transformed header styling with bg-slate-800/50 backdrop-blur-sm and border-slate-700\n     - Updated all platform & source badge colors to use dark theme with opacity and borders:\n       - Meta: bg-blue-900/30 text-blue-400 border border-blue-700/50\n       - Google: bg-red-900/30 text-red-400 border border-red-700/50\n       - Manual: bg-yellow-900/30 text-yellow-400 border border-yellow-700/50\n       - API: bg-green-900/30 text-green-400 border border-green-700/50\n     - Complete dark theme transformation for table styling with proper containers, headers, and hover states\n     - Updated modal form with dark theme styling including backdrop blur and semantic error messages\n     - Added consistent rounded corners (rounded-xl, rounded-2xl) for modern look\n     - Implemented glassmorphism effects throughout the page",
        "testStrategy": "1. Manually review each affected page (Log Call, View Calls, Enhanced Call Logging, Ad Spend) to confirm all UI elements use the Supabase theme colors and styles.\n2. Use browser dev tools to inspect elements and verify no hardcoded or legacy color values remain.\n3. Check for consistent button, input, and form styling across all pages, including error and focus states.\n4. Validate dark mode rendering and semantic color usage for accessibility (contrast ratios, focus indicators).\n5. Solicit feedback from design stakeholders and perform a visual regression test (using Storybook or screenshots) to ensure adherence to the styling guide.\n6. Run automated UI tests (if available) to catch regressions.",
