        "details": "1. **Theme Integration:**\n   - Install and configure the Supabase theme from TweakCN using shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS. Import the theme preset (e.g., via `npx shadcn@latest add https://www.shadcn.io/registry/supabase.json` or use `@madooei/shadcn-theme-presets` for runtime theme management)[2][3][4].\n   - Ensure the theme is globally applied, including dark mode defaults and semantic color variables in the global CSS.\n\n2. **Component Refactoring:**\n   - Audit all pages (Log Call, View Calls, Enhanced Call Logging, Ad Spend) for deviations from the theme.\n   - Update the Log Call button to use theme-compliant background, border, and hover states (replace white backgrounds with semantic theme colors).\n   - Refactor the View Calls page to remove non-theme colors (white/purple/blue) and apply theme palette for backgrounds, text, and accents.\n   - Fix the Enhanced Call Logging page FormField error by ensuring all form components use shadcn/ui primitives and theme variables for error states, borders, and focus rings.\n   - Update the Ad Spend page to match the styling guide: use theme backgrounds, text, and accent colors, and ensure consistent spacing and typography.\n\n3. **Best Practices:**\n   - Use Tailwind CSS utility classes with theme variables for all custom styles.\n   - Ensure all interactive elements (buttons, inputs, links) have accessible contrast and consistent focus/hover states.\n   - Remove hardcoded colors and replace with semantic tokens from the theme.\n   - Test in both dark and light modes (if supported), but prioritize dark mode as default.\n   - Document any custom overrides in a central theme file for maintainability.\n\n4. **Tooling:**\n   - Use Prettier and ESLint to enforce code style.\n   - Leverage Storybook or a similar tool to visually verify component consistency if available.\n\n5. **Collaboration:**\n   - Communicate with design stakeholders to confirm visual alignment with the TweakCN Supabase theme and the styling guide.\n\n6. **Implementation Progress:**\n   - **Log Call Page (/calls/new):**\n     - Replaced white background (bg-gray-50) with dark theme gradient\n     - Updated loading state to use primary theme colors\n     - Implemented proper dark theme colors for success state\n     - Aligned error message styling with dark theme guidelines\n   \n   - **View Calls Page (/calls):**\n     - Implemented dark theme gradient background throughout\n     - Added slate-800/50 backdrop blur and proper borders to header\n     - Updated navigation with primary color accents and hover states\n     - Redesigned main content card with slate-800/50 background and rounded corners\n     - Applied dark theme colors to table with proper contrast\n     - Converted all status and outcome badges to use theme colors\n     - Implemented dark theme styling for empty state\n     - Replaced purple accent colors with primary theme colors\n     - Added consistent hover effects and transitions\n     - Incorporated glassmorphism effects per TweakCN Supabase guidelines\n\n   - **Enhanced Call Logging Page (/calls/enhanced):**\n     - Fixed FormField import error by replacing all instances with EnhancedFormField\n     - Updated all purple colors to use primary theme colors throughout the page\n     - Implemented dark theme gradient background with proper semantic colors\n     - Added glassmorphism effects with backdrop blur and proper borders\n     - Ensured consistent primary color usage for all interactive elements\n     - Applied proper semantic color classes for text and backgrounds\n     - Enhanced hover and focus states with primary theme colors\n     - All components now follow TweakCN Supabase theme guidelines\n     \n   - **Ad Spend Page (/ad-spend):**\n     - Updated loading state from white background and blue spinner to dark theme gradient and primary colors\n     - Replaced main page background (bg-gray-50) with dark theme gradient (bg-gradient-to-br from-slate-900 via-slate-800 to-slate-900)\n     - Transformed header styling with bg-slate-800/50 backdrop-blur-sm and border-slate-700\n     - Updated all platform & source badge colors to use dark theme with opacity and borders:\n       - Meta: bg-blue-900/30 text-blue-400 border border-blue-700/50\n       - Google: bg-red-900/30 text-red-400 border border-red-700/50\n       - Manual: bg-yellow-900/30 text-yellow-400 border border-yellow-700/50\n       - API: bg-green-900/30 text-green-400 border border-green-700/50\n     - Complete dark theme transformation for table styling with proper containers, headers, and hover states\n     - Updated modal form with dark theme styling including backdrop blur and semantic error messages\n     - Added consistent rounded corners (rounded-xl, rounded-2xl) for modern look\n     - Implemented glassmorphism effects throughout the page",

Fetch traffic source data from the enhanced calls database (with UTM/referrer fields) and Meta Ads API integration. Aggregate and classify traffic using logic from Task 22.\n\n3. **Real-Time Metrics Display**: Implement live metric updates above the kanban board using WebSockets or server-sent events. Metrics should reflect current performance and update instantly as new calls or campaign data arrive.\n\n4. **Historical Trend Analysis**: Render time-series charts showing trends for key metrics (close rate, show rate, cost per lead, ROI) by traffic source and campaign. Support dynamic date range selection and interactive filtering.\n\n5. **Campaign-Level Analytics**: Provide drill-down views for individual Meta ad campaigns and organic sources, leveraging data from Meta Ads API (Task 18) and UTM tracking (Task 22).\n\n6. **Client-Specific Filtering**: Enforce multi-tenant isolation using workspace context from the database schema (Task 3) and workspace management logic (Task 20). All analytics must be scoped to the selected client workspace.\n\n7. **Interactive Visualizations**: Use Chart.js or Recharts for modern, interactive charts. Enable tooltips, filtering, and dynamic legend toggling. Ensure accessibility and usability for all roles.\n\n8. **Export Functionality**: Implement CSV and XLSX export options for analytics tables and charts. Use libraries like SheetJS for client-side export, ensuring data privacy and workspace isolation.\n\n9. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize database queries for large datasets using indexed fields, pagination, and caching (e.g., Redis or Supabase edge functions). Profile and minimize API response times for dashboard endpoints.\n\n10. **Role-Based Access**: Integrate with RBAC (Task 4) to show different analytics views based on user roles. Admins see all data; sales reps see only assigned calls and relevant metrics.\n\n11. **Mobile Responsive Design**: Ensure all dashboard components adapt gracefully to mobile screens, with touch-friendly controls and readable charts.\n\n**Best Practices**: Follow modern dashboard design patterns: clear separation of summary and detail views, actionable insights, and intuitive navigation.
