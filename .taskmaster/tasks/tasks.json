Database Operation Middleware:**\n- Hooks into Prisma middleware for database operations\n- Tracks all database queries with timing information\n- Records affected records and change details\n- Maintains data lineage for compliance requirements\n\n**4. Integration with Audit Service:**\n- Uses the AuditService singleton for consistent logging\n- Implements batching for performance optimization\n- Handles asynchronous logging to prevent request blocking\n- Provides correlation between related audit events\n\n**5. Security Features:**\n- Implements data sanitization to prevent sensitive data logging\n- Supports field-level redaction for PII and sensitive information\n- Configurable retention policies for compliance\n- Tamper-evident logging with hash chains\n\n**6. Performance Considerations:**\n- Minimal impact on request processing time\n- Efficient memory usage with stream processing\n- Configurable sampling rates for high-volume endpoints\n- Automatic compression for large payload logging\n\nThe middleware implementation provides comprehensive, configurable audit logging across all application layers while maintaining high performance and security standards.\n</info added on 2025-09-28T13:58:28.368Z>",
