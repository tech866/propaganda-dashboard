## üöÄ **Next Steps to Complete Setup**

### **1. Run Database Migration**
The new tables need to be created in Supabase. Run this SQL script in your Supabase dashboard:

```sql

```

### **2. Test the Form**
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/calls/enhanced`
3. Test the conditional logic by selecting "SDR Call" vs "Non-SDR Booked Call"
4. Verify all form fields work correctly
5. Test form submission to ensure data is saved to Supabase

### **3. Verify Supabase Integration**
Run the test script to verify all tables are accessible:
```bash
node test-enhanced-call-form.js
```
