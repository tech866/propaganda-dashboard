-- FIX RLS POLICIES - Remove Infinite Recursion

-- =====================================================
-- CREATE SIMPLIFIED RLS POLICIES (No Recursion)
-- =====================================================

-- For now, let's create simple policies that allow authenticated users to access data
-- This avoids the recursion issue while maintaining basic security

-- Users table policies
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to view users" ON users
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to insert users" ON users
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to update users" ON users
    FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

-- Clients table policies
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to view clients" ON clients
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to insert clients" ON clients
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to update clients" ON clients
    FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

-- Calls table policies
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to view calls" ON calls
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to insert calls" ON calls
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to update calls" ON calls
    FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

-- Loss reasons table policies
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to view loss reasons" ON loss_reasons
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to insert loss reasons" ON loss_reasons
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to update loss reasons" ON loss_reasons
    FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

-- =====================================================
-- SUCCESS MESSAGE
-- =====================================================

-- âœ… RLS policies fixed! No more infinite recursion.
-- These simplified policies allow authenticated users to access data
-- while maintaining basic security. You can refine them later as needed.
